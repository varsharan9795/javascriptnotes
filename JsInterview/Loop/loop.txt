 Loop
  ====================================================================================
   loop is a programming to way to run a piece of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
  for,while,do-while,for-of,for-in

  for() :- for loop allows to iterate a block of code a specific number of times.

while() :- while loop execute a block of code while a certain condition is true.

break
======
the break statement is used to terminate the loop.

continue
========
continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on the next iteration.

for and forof
=============
for loop is slightly more complex having more lines of code whereas for..of is much simpler and better for iterating arrays.

for of and for in
==================
for-of loop is used to loop through the values of an object likes arrays string.
for-in loop used to loop through the properties of an object.

forEach():- that allow you to iterate over each element of the array and perform some action on each element.
