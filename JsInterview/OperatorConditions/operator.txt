DATA TYPE

PRIMITIVE)    :-numbers,strings,booleans,undefined,null
NON-PRIMITIVE):-Object,array,Function,date 

Types of JavaScript Operators
==============================
Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
String Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Ternary Operators
Type Operators

)Arithmetic Operators
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

)Assignment Operators
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y

)Comparison Operators
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator

)Logical Operators
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not

condition statement
===================
if/else
ternary operator
switch statement
  

  OPERATOR
========
1. unary
2.binary
3.ternary

short circuit 
=============
short circuit evaluation stops the execution as soon the result can be determined without evaluating the remaining sub-expression.

operator precedence
====================
As per operator precedence,operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

 difference between == and ===
 ==============================
 ==(loose equality) operator compare two values for equality after performing type coercion.
 ===(strict equality) operator compare two values for equality without performing.


 spread operator
 ===============
 spread operator(...) is used to expand or spread from an itrable such as(array string or object) into individual elements.
 1. copying array
 2. merging array
 3. passing multiple arguments to a function.

 Rest Operators
 ==============
 The rest operator is used in function parameters to collect all remaining arguments into an array.
