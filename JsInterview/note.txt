concat() :- joins two or more strings:

The trim() :-method removes whitespace from both sides of a string:

The trimStart():- method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.

 ===============
keys in  a map can be of data type including strings number object function etc.
key in regular javascript object are limited to strings and symbols.

event type
=============
click,mouseover,keydown,keypress,keyup,submit,focus, blur, change,load,resize.

event object
============
event object passes it as an argument to the event handler.

event Delegation
=================
event delegation in javascript is a javascript is a technique where you attach a single event handler to a parent element to handle events on its child elements

event bubbling
================
event bubbling is the process in javascript where in event triggerd on  a child element propagate up the DOM tree. triggered event handles on its parent elements.
